At Warp, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. So if you're excited about this role, but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every qualification in this job description – we encourage you to apply anyways! We are a community of curious learners, and most of us are learning some skills for the first time (like our engineers learning to program Warp in Rust). You might be just the right candidate for this or other roles.




Salary Transparency




Total compensation at Warp consists of two parts: 1) a competitive base salary, and most importantly, 2) meaningful equity.




When we find the right person, we try to put our best foot forward with an offer that excites you. We consider what you'd like to be paid, the skills and level of experience you bring, what similar jobs pay, and make sure there's equal pay for equal work among those you'll be working with. The budgeted compensation amount for this role is targeted at $135,000 - $195,000.




In addition to salary, all employees receive further compensation in the form of equity in the company. This is a meaningful stock option grant with a four-year vesting period and one-year cliff. Your equity is where most of the significant upside potential is. Comparing startup equity is always a bit tricky, so we're happy to walk you through different valuation scenarios at the offer stage in order to help paint a clearer picture of the upside.




Final total compensation is determined by multiple factors including your experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above.

About Warp




We are a company run by product-first builders, building a core product for all developers. We are committed to understanding our users deeply. We believe we will ultimately build the best product and business if that team includes developers and designers from a wide range of backgrounds. The early team comes from Google, Dropbox, Gem, LinkedIn, and Facebook. We are looking for passionate individuals to join us and help bring Warp to the world.




We value honesty, humility, and pragmatism, and our core product principle is focusing on the user. If you're interested in learning more about our company values and what our engineering team culture is like, please take a look at our internal How We Work guide.




We're very fortunate to be backed by a great group of venture capital firms. In October 2021, we closed a $17M Series A ($23M total raised), led by Dylan Field (Co-Founder and CEO, Figma).

The Product




Here's a quick demo showing some of our current features…




This is just the start, as our plan is to build out a set of experiences in the terminal that don't exist today like collaboration, environment sharing, rich data types and more.




The Opportunity




The terminal is one of very few tools used by every developer every day, which makes it an ideal gateway to improving all sorts of developer activities. We believe there is an opportunity to build a unicorn-sized business improving the command-line. Our strategy is bottom-up developer adoption, followed by driving revenue through enterprise sales and distribution partnerships.




To start, our goal is to become the everyday terminal of choice with individual users – immediately usable as a backwards-compatible terminal replacement with the developer's shell of choice. We have built a closed-source server, which will implement all of the cloud-enabled features. These features will invite users to share their work with others, driving growth and encouraging collaboration. We'll also focus on building a community and an ecosystem of terminal plugins and apps, creating network effects.




At higher levels of team penetration, we will offer an enterprise plan with features around privacy, security and environment management (e.g. secure distribution and management of API keys). These larger enterprise plans will be the ultimate driver of revenue, along with potential distribution deals for companies that see CLI integrations as a way to reach new customers.

You'll use tools like Preset and Tableau to unlock the potential of our rapidly growing data sets, uncover hidden trends, and transform raw information into actionable insights. Your work will extend beyond the confines of your desk as you collaborate closely with executive leadership and represent your findings to the entire company.

Imagine the satisfaction of knowing that your analysis and visualizations directly influence strategic decisions made by our top leaders. You'll have the opportunity to interact regularly with our executive team, presenting your insights and recommendations and contributing to the overall growth and success of the organization.

This role reports to our Vice President of Data Science and will be supported by our larger Data Science and Software Engineering teams.

MarginEdge: Where hospitality meets technology

As a team built by former (and current!) restaurant operators, our mission is to bring operators the same energy, attention to detail, and passion that they bring to their guests. Our culture is deeply rooted in service, partially because that’s where so many of our team come from (including everyone on our Business Development team), but also because we believe it is just the right way to run a business. We design our software with profound empathy for the complexity of running a restaurant, and the goal of making the magic just a little easier for operators by taking the complex (read: very annoying) back office tasks off their plate, while empowering them with real-time data.

Our founders share a deep history in both owning and operating restaurants and in building successful tech companies. We are venture-backed and serve 4,400+ restaurants across the US and Canada.

We enable restaurants to make magic while knowing we are doing the same for them.

Essential Functions / Responsibilities

Learn everything about the MarginEdge data model. Guide the development of a data model that will support reporting on strategic initiatives for the company. Be an active participant in our code review process for reports.
Respond to feedback from others and provide a quality check on reports built by other teams at the company.

Experience using Salesforce for reporting or analysis would be a bonus


What’s it like to work for MarginEdge?

We work hard, we work fast and we fuel our work with a commitment of transparency from leadership, straight talk and trust between teams. We believe that the best people do their best work when they feel empowered - so whether you are remote or in our office (likely eating a catered lunch from our clients in our baller, brand new penthouse HQ in Ballston) you get to work with your manager to call your shot on what works best for you. Did we mention it has a full commercial kitchen and is walking distance (covered walking, that is) from the metro?

Benefits (Shut The Front Door, They Are Amazing)

To fuel this rocket ship, we need to build a team as passionate about our work and product as we are. We believe that top talent (that’s you!) should feel deeply connected to their work, appreciated for the time they give to building our organization, and have the balance necessary to give their best during work hours and all those after-hours too.

We do this by offering a suite of kick-ass benefits not only to be competitive and catch the eye of super-smart people (that’s you again!) but also to provide the foundation for a career you love and a life outside of work you love just as much.

Unlimited Paid Time Off (and we mean it, we encourage your healthy work-life balance!)

The NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) requires a contractor to lead development of an analytical framework to assess potential impacts to NMFS stock assessments and the rest of the ecosystem that could arise due to the displacement of commercial fishing effort from areas being developed by new ocean‐use sectors such as Offshore Wind (OSW). Work will be performed in collaboration with the California Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (CCIEA) research group.
Activities will include: identifying species most likely to be affected by OSW development through the displacement of commercial fishing; 2) developing population, multispecies and/or ecosystem models for species‐of‐interest; 3) developing spatial scenarios of current and likely areas for OSW development across the U.S. West Coast; and 4) simulating population, multi‐species and/or ecosystem dynamics using the OSW development scenarios to identify how, and at what spatial scale, species’ demographic parameters may change as a result of newly‐closed fishing grounds.
This position is contingent upon contract award.

Qualifications:

PhD degree from an accredited college or university with a major directly related in a field of study as related to the requirements of specific task order with emphasis in marine science, fisheries, quantitative ecology, oceanography, data science, or similar fields; or, equivalent relevant experience

Demonstrated proficiency and experience working with and developing spatial population, multi‐species or ecosystem modeling frameworks
Demonstrated proficiency and experience with spatial software tools such as GIS or spatial packages in R
Excellent written and oral communications skills, coordination and collaboration skills, and a willingness to learn new skills, update existing skills, and share skills with colleagues in the CCIEA team

Responsibilities:

Responsibilities include but are not limited to:

Task One: identify species of interest

1.1 Organize discussion with CCIEA and NMFS stock assessment biologists on which species would most likely experience demographic changes due to displacement of commercial fishing effort in and around OSW development areas.
1.2 Narrow species list to subset compatible with selected models chosen in Task Two.
1.3 Discuss and identify parameters of interest for reporting results.

Task Two: develop population, multi‐species and/or ecosystem models

2.1 Review spatial fisheries management (e.g., marine protected area) literature for best‐practices analyses and models capable of identifying changes in species’ population demographics inside and outside areas closed to extractive activities, such as fishing.
2.2 Organize discussion with CCIEA team to finalize selected model(s).
2.3 Lead and coordinate development of population, multi‐species and/or ecosystem models.

Task Three: develop spatial scenarios of OSW development

3.1 Create spatial data layers that include all known West Coast BOEM lease areas and estimated energy to be derived from each area (in order to anticipate additional lease areas that may be needed in the future to meet state and federal OSW goals).
3.2 In collaboration with the NMFS West Coast Offshore Wind Energy Coordination
(OWEC) team, identify areas across the US West Coast that will most likely be areas of future OSW development.
3.3 In collaboration with the NMFS West Coast Offshore Wind Energy Coordination (OWEC) and CCIEA teams, create scenarios of OSW development based on results from Tasks 3.1 and 3.2 and state and federal goals and timelines (i.e. < stated federal and state goals, equal to goals, or > goals).
3.4 If timing allows, consider spatial‐closure scenarios that vary substantially in spatial coverage and configuration across the U.S. West Coast in order to understand the magnitude and spatial arrangement of development that would be required to alter population demographics or ecosystem dynamics.

Task Four: simulate and report model dynamics using the OSW development scenarios

4.1 Simulate model dynamics across scenarios from Task 3.
4.2 Summarize prioritized demographic parameters for species‐of‐interest across each OSW scenario
4.3 In collaboration with the CCIEA team and NWFSC stock assessment biologists, develop final figures and text for a manuscript reporting results.

What Does a Data Analyst Do?

A data analyst is a person whose job is to gather and interpret data in order to solve a specific problem. The role includes plenty of time spent with data but entails communicating findings too.




Here’s what many data analysts do on a day-to-day basis:




Gather data: Analysts often collect data themselves. This could include conducting surveys, tracking visitor characteristics on a company website, or buying datasets from data collection specialists.
Clean data: Raw data might contain duplicates, errors, or outliers. Cleaning the data means maintaining the quality of data in a spreadsheet or through a programming language so that your interpretations won’t be wrong or skewed.
Model data: This entails creating and designing the structures of a database. You might choose what types of data to store and collect, establish how data categories are related to each other, and work through how the data actually appears.
Interpret data: Interpreting data will involve finding patterns or trends in data that could answer the question at hand.
Present: Communicating the results of your findings will be a key part of your job. You do this by putting together visualizations like charts and graphs, writing reports, and presenting information to interested parties.




**APPLY NOW TO LEARN MORE!***

In 2011 SkySlope started as an idea born at the kitchen table of our CEO, with just him and two others. Headquartered in Sacramento, California, we have since grown out of our previous 3 offices and many of our close to 180 employees are spread all across the United States. Those 180 employees support close to 300,000 users across 5,000 offices nationwide and now in Canada as well. Included in that is 8 out of the 15 largest Real Estate Brokerages in the nation.




But, despite being happy with what we’ve achieved we know that as industry leaders in our space there’s a lot of work left to be done. All of the growth and success that has happened is a result of us obsessing over building cutting edge software that makes the Real Estate world a better place. We know this only happens by hiring people who don’t just come up with out of the box ideas but hiring people who actually see those ideas through and bring them to life. As we’ve grown, we’ve been fortunate enough to hire plenty of people who possess that quality and realize it’s equally important to hire people who can pair that skill with empathy, collaboration, and a keen sense of urgency. If you’re looking to join a company where you can have real impact and surround yourself with an incredible team of people then look no further.

351,2023-07-29,Spatial Data Analyst,WA,"Lynker Corporation is seeking to hire a Spatial Data Analyst to support a contract with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) Conservation Biology (CB) Division. This is a full-time position on-site at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, Washington. The position is anticipated to begin on October 1st, 2023. Hiring for this position is contingent upon contract award.




NMFS requires support to inform the scientific research objectives associated with the responsible and sustainable development of the offshore wind (OSW) energy sector. The California Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (CCIEA) provides science support for ecosystem-based management of the California Current along the US West Coast and provides a framework and delivery system for co-developed, integrative science products to inform management decisions that intersect ocean-use communities.




NMFS is interested in determining how population dynamics of commercial fisheries species may change due to fishery closures associated with OSW energy areas. There is concern about how changes in population and ecosystem dynamics caused by OSW energy development will affect the reliability of decision support tools, such as the stock assessments that underpin harvest advice to fisheries managers. The focus of this position is to address these questions and concerns by improving knowledge around how OSW development will affect fisheries stocks and ecosystem dynamics, including fisheries and fishing communities.




In collaboration with CCIEA scientists, this position will lead activities and develop products to improve understanding of how OSW development will impact fisheries stocks, informing stock assessments and harvest management advice. An analytical framework will be developed to assess potential impacts on NMFS stock assessments and the ecosystem due to the displacement of commercial fishing effort from areas being developed by new ocean-use sectors such as OSW. The scientific advice provided will promote responsible and sustainable OSW development while ensuring fisheries management advice is well-informed of the potential risks of future spatial management scenarios.




Tasks




Identify Species of Interest
Organize discussion with CCIEA and NMFS stock assessment biologists on which species would most likely experience demographic changes due to displacement of commercial fishing effort in and around OSW development areas.
Narrow species list to subset compatible with selected models chosen in Task #2.
Discuss and identify parameters of interest for reporting results.
Develop Population, Multi-species, and/or Ecosystem Models
Review spatial fisheries management literature for best-practices analyses and models capable of identifying changes in species' population demographics inside and outside areas closed to extractive activities, such as fishing.
Organize discussion with CCIEA team to finalize selected model(s).
Lead and coordinate development of population, multi-species, and/or ecosystem models.
Develop Spatial Scenarios of OSW Development
Create spatial data layers that include all known West Coast BOEM lease areas and estimated energy to be derived from each area to anticipate lease areas.
In collaboration with the NMFS West Coast Offshore Wind Energy Coordination (OWEC) team, identify areas across the US West Coast that will most likely be areas of future OSW development.
In collaboration with the NMFS West Coast OWEC and CCIEA teams, create scenarios of OSW development based on results from the two previous tasks and state and federal goals and timelines.
If timing allows, consider spatial-closure scenarios that vary substantially in spatial coverage and configuration across the U.S. West Coast in order to understand the magnitude and spatial arrangement of development that would be required to alter population demographics or ecosystem dynamics.
Simulate and Report Model Dynamics Using OSW Development Scenarios
Simulate model dynamics across scenarios from Task #3.
Summarize prioritized demographic parameters for species-of-interest across each OSW scenario.
In collaboration with the CCIEA team and NWFSC stock assessment biologists, develop final figures and text for a manuscript reporting results.




Deliverables




Deliverables for this role related to the above tasks will include, but not necessarily be limited to the following:




Developing a prioritized list of targeted fisheries species or other ecologically important species according to the importance of understanding how OSW will affect their demographics.
Organizing and summarizing the pros and cons of various models that can be used to identify changes in demographic parameters related to the displacement of fishing effort inside and outside closed areas.
Developing well-documented and shareable code for selected models.
Developing metadata and spatial data layer files that organize the identified OSW development scenarios.
Producing a manuscript that summarizes the results of the selected model(s) under each OSW development scenario.
Providing a monthly status progress report, which includes a summary of all work performed, an assessment of technical progress, schedule status, any travel conducted, and any concerns or recommendations for the reporting period.




Requirements




PhD degree from an accredited college or university with a major directly related in a field of study as related to the requirements of this role, with an emphasis in marine science, fisheries, quantitative ecology, oceanography, data science, or similar fields; or, equivalent relevant experience.
Demonstrated proficiency and experience with data management and statistical analysis using statistical software such as R, MATLAB, etc., and/or programming languages such as Python.
Demonstrated proficiency and experience working with and developing spatial population, multi-species, or ecosystem modeling frameworks.
Demonstrated proficiency and experience with spatial software tools such as GIS or spatial packages in R.
Good communication, coordination, and collaboration skills, and a willingness to learn new skills, update existing skills, and share skills with colleagues in the CCIEA team.




The selected candidate for this position will work up to 40 hours per week. Travel is anticipated for this role to attend regional meetings and conferences to discuss and present project related work and objectives.

Here’s how it works: When a company is seeking out a vendor that will have access to its sensitive data, that company must assess the vendor to ensure it meets certain information security thresholds. This assessment process results in cumbersome, clunky, and slow spreadsheets emailed back and forth — eating up info security resources and ultimately delaying deals.




That’s where Whistic comes in. Our market-defining platform enables security and sales teams to proactively conduct and respond to third party security assessments by streamlining and automating the process, transforming the work for companies all over the world, saving professionals valuable time, and ultimately helping to safeguard sensitive information.
